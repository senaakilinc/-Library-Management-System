The Library Management System is designed to optimize the study space in a university library by allowing students to view available tables, make reservations, and receive real-time updates on occupancy. The system addresses the inefficiencies of the current manual process by integrating a digital reservation system, ensuring fair and effective use of library resources. It features user authentication, table reservation, hourly occupancy checks, and notification alerts for expired reservations. The project follows an object-oriented approach and incorporates a structured database to manage user interactions efficiently.
